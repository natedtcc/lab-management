
Delaware Tech Lab Management


During my internship at Delaware Tech, I was given the assignment of creating a website that allowed the professors in the IT department keep better track of their inventory, namely their hard drives. These drives are lent out to students throughout the semester for coursework, and were previously kept track of with a paper log. I designed a website that required students to create an account and register their hard drive.

Since the students are using these hard drives with some of Del Tech's servers for coursework, I also implemented a feature on the site that allows a student to lease a server. To summarize, this page keeps track of which students have which hard drives, and what server they are using, or have used.

Utilizing what I'd learned at school, I designed the system from the ground up, using PHP and Bootstrap. I implemented my system using a LAMP stack running on Ubuntu 18. The site has many admin features that not only log drive and server leases to a logfile, but also a web interface that allows for complete modification of any relavant data found within the database.
